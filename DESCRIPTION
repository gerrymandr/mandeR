Description: Calculates a variety of compactness measures, which are useful for detecting and analyzing gerrymandering of electoral districts. Measures provided include Polsby-Popper, Area/Convex Hull, Schwartzberg, and Reock. The package accounts for many possible ambiguities in the way these scores are defined. Interfaces for efficiently processing bulk data without intermdiate loading are provided.
