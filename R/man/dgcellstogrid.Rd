\title{Return boundary coordinates for specified cells}
\usage{
dgcellstogrid(dggs, cells, frame = TRUE, wrapcells = TRUE, savegrid = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dggs}{A dggs object from dgconstruct()}

\item{cells}{The cells to get the boundaries of}

\item{frame}{If TRUE, return a data frame suitable for ggplot plotting.
If FALSE, return an OGR poly object}

\item{wrapcells}{Cells which cross -180/180 degrees can present 
difficulties for plotting. Setting this TRUE will result in
cells with components in both hemispheres to be mapped
entirely to positive degrees (the Eastern hemisphere). As a
result, such cells will have components in the range
[180,360). Only used when \code{frame=TRUE}.}

\item{savegrid}{If savegrid is set to a file path, then a shapefile 
containing the grid is written to that path and the filename
is returned. No other manipulations are done.
Default: NA (do not save grid, return it)}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame or OGR poly object, as specified by \code{frame}.
        If \code{savegrid=TRUE}, returns a filename.
}
\description{
Returns the coordinates constituting the boundary of a 
                 specified set of cells. Duplicates are eliminated to reduce
                 processing and storage requirements.

\examples{
library(dggridR)
data(dgquakes)

#Construct a grid with cells about ~1000 miles wide
dggs          <- dgconstruct(spacing=1000,metric=FALSE) 
dgquakes$cell <- dgtransform(dggs,dgquakes$lat,dgquakes$lon)

#Get grid cells for the earthquakes identified
grid          <- dgcellstogrid(dggs, dgquakes$cell, frame=TRUE)
